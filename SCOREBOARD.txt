 status of job CI( $BOARD , dev-testing)   good  => all examples in CI job ran, otherwise first fail

25-09-2021 - added temperature and digi_pot to CI job. The result in temperature is FAKED for several hals.
28-09-2021 - switched from stm32f722 to stm32f769 because adc is not yet supported in hal for former.

> rtic examples do not work with `stm32f0xx-hal` and `stm32l0xx-hal` and are skipped.

> temperature example skips actual read/calculation on several hals because of problems.

> `stm32l0xx-hal` jobs working only on my special branch because of  UPDATE CONFLICT

> `stm32f3xx-hal` and `stm32l1xx-hal` jobs working only using non-default hal branch because of  UPDATE CONFLICT
