// THIS NEEDS WORK. compare projects/temperature-display.rs
// NOTE THAT impl DelayNs does not work dht11::read as of Feb 2024.
//    It still needs DelayUs which is called DelayUsType below.

//! Measure temperature with 10k thermistor sensor (NTC 3950 10k thermistors probe) and temperature and
//! humidity from a DHT-11 (or DHT-22) sensor. Display on SSD1306 OLED display.
//! 
//! One side of the thermistor is connected to GND and other side to adc pin and also through
//! a 10k sresistor to VCC. That makes the max voltage about VCC/2, so about 2.5v when VCC is 5v.
//! and 1.6v when vcc is 3.2v. This is convenient for adc pins that are not 5v tolerant.
//! This means the voltage varies inversely compared to connecting throught the resistor to GND 
//! as is sometimes done. (Since NTC resistance goes down as temperature goes up, this means
//! higher temperature gives higher voltage measurement.) Regarding NTC thermistors see, 
//! for example, https://eepower.com/resistor-guide/resistor-types/ntc-thermistor/#
//!
//! If 3.3v is supplied through BluePill regulator from 5v USB probe BEWARE of regulator current limit.
//! Some places it is claimed that when the limit is exceeded then 5v is supplied but mine failed 
//! by dropping voltage to 2.8v when the SSD1306, 10k thermistor and DHT-11 were on the 3.3v using 
//! USB power rather than battery. It ran but 10K temperature accuracy is questionable.
//!
//! See setup() functions for thepin settings on various boards.
//! 
//! See misc/temperature.rs and misc/temperature_display.rs for other sensors and 
//! the internal mcu temperature measurement.
//! 
//! Note that the DisplaySize setting needs to be adjusted for 128x64 or 128x32 display.
//! 
//! The SSD1306 OLED display connects to the I2C bus: VCC  (or VDD) to 3.3v, and also to GND, SDA, and SCL. 
//! 
//! Voltage at the thermistor to fixed resistor connection is measured on the ADC pin.
//! The choice of 10k series resistor in the voltage divider ...
//! Values in the temperature calculation below are very rough based on my extremely crude calibration
//! effort, but see for example 
//!     https://www.mathscinotes.com/2014/05/yet-another-thermistor-discussion/
