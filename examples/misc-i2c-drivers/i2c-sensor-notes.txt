Notes on various issues as of Dec. 2024.

To simplify testing the examples *semi* use only the sensor crate and report results
with semihosting. This means the example does not need ssd or anything that would may
the example actually useable. (This is prompted by what seems to be a run time bug in stm32f4xx.)

At present there appears to be a run time bug in hal stm32f4xx affecting I2C.

The crate xca9548a provides multiplexing of sensors with the same address.
It is now converted to embedded-hal v1.0.0. That seems to mean that
crates for devices attached to the multiplexer also need to use eh-1.
(At least it is difficult if not impossible when they use older eh.
The problem is with trait bounds not being satisfied, which appears to come
from having two versions of eh.)

Thus sensor crates should:

 - Be using eh-1 and be no_std.
 - Sensor intialization should return a Result so that it is posible to identify.
     when some sensors are not attached.
 - Allow for software reset so individual sensors can be reset without power cycle.
 - Syncronous is necessary (at the moment because of rtic difficulties) but the
     feature of getting both sync and async from the same crate is nice.
 - Preferably the sensor should borrow rather than consume delay. If the delay is
   consumed then with multiplexing a large number of delays are used. This can
   be done with cortex_m::asm::delay but that adds unnecessary complication.

So, by above criteria:
(*semi* examples used for compiled/works remarks)

AHT10 - There are not yet any eh-1 crates. 
      - Crate aht10-async (https://github.com/jneem/aht10-async)
            uses  embedded-hal-async = "1.0.0"  but is only async.
  
AHT20 - Crate aht20  (https://github.com/blueluna/aht20) uses eh-1 but a Result not returned
        so not good for xca9548a use. Also it consumes delay.  
        It works with stm32g4xx on stm32g474xE. 
        It compiles with stm32f4xx on stm32f411 but run fails.


      - Crate embedded-aht20  (https://github.com/ghismary/embedded-aht20) uses eh-1, and
        returns Result, and has feature option for sync or async. 
        It works with stm32g4xx on stm32g474xE. 
        It compiles with stm32f4xx on stm32f401 but run fails.

      - Crate aht20-driver (https://github.com/anglerud/aht20-driver) uses eh-1, and
        does not consume delay. Result returned by .init method.
        It works with stm32g4xx on stm32g474xE. 
        It compiles with stm32f4xx on stm32f401 but run fails.


AHT21 - There are not yet any eh-1 crates.
